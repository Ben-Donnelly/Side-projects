# Side-projects
Side projects when I was bored or had an idea

* **BruteForceHelloWorld**:
Brute forces any inputed string (originally "Hello, World") as I thought it would be fun to make the easiest/most basic program difficult...for fun **looks best when run from cmd line**
* **FloodScammer**:
Credential flooder for phishing scams

* **InstaBot**:
Selenium tool to find out who you follow but who dosent follow you back **NOTE:** Instagram don't like the automation of their site and so are known to change paths, class names, id's etc. regularly so at any given time the program could be broken. If so it should just be a simple matter of updating paths, id's etc.

* **LottoQuickPick**:
A lotto quick pick line generator

* **Web Scraping Temperatures**: 
Links to website used were removed before submission to avoid any copyright issues

* **cognitive concentration**: 
Fills out x * x square grid with numbers in range x * x (i.e. 5 would initialise 5 * 5 grid with numbers 1-25) Objective: Can print off and cross numbers off in order and time length taken, as time decreases increase size. This can help with concentration as it requires focus, memory e.t.c.

* **substing squares**: 
program to calculate some numbers where any substring of that number added with remaining numbers squared, equals the number itself
